<title>NHS Crawler - Sam Wright</title>
<h3>Web app for crawling and searching the NHS Choices website's conditions pages.</h3>
<p>
    <h4>The API</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="/crawler/start">/crawler/start</a> to start crawling the website. This will
            take days to complete. You can stop the crawler and/or restart the
            app, then start the crawler again and it will resume from where it
            stopped. See the log output or <a href="/crawler/status">/crawler/status</a> to monitor its
            progress. Newly-crawled pages are added to the index for searching every 10 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="/crawler/status">/crawler/status</a> to get the status of the crawler (as a json string
            of io.github.samwright.nhs.crawler.CrawlerStatus).
        </li>
        <li><a href="/crawler/stop">/crawler/stop</a> to stop the crawler if it was running</li>
        <li>
            <a href="/search/reindex">/search/reindex</a> to recreate the index from the crawled pages on disk. This
            can be called at any time, even while the crawler is running. This takes about a minute to complete, and
            its progress can be monitored at <a href="/search/status">/search/status</a>. You only need to do this if
            you copy json files yourself into the pages directory.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="/search/status">/search/status</a> to get the status of the indexer (as a json string of
            io.github.samwright.nhs.search.IndexingStatus).
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="/search?q=mumps">/search?q=mumps</a> to search through the indexed pages for 'mumps' to get the
            best match, and return its NHS Choices URL.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="/search/multiple?q=mumps">/search/multiple?q=mumps</a> to search through the indexed pages for
            'mumps' to get multiple top matches (at most 10), and return them in order in a json string of a
            list of io.github.samwright.nhs.search.SearchResult.
        </li>
    </ul>
